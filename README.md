# Flask-small-task---Todo
This is a small project I created as a task while learning Flask. As a Django developer, I found it easy to understand the Flask framework for deploying ML models.

This is a simple todo application created using Flask. The purpose of this project is to help me learn Flask and practice creating web applications using the framework.
