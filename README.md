# Flask-small-task---Todo
This is a small project I created as a task while learning Flask. As a Django developer, I found it easy to understand the Flask framework for deploying ML models.

The purpose of this project is to deploy a machine learning model using Flask API. The model used in this project is a simple logistic regression model trained on the iris dataset. The Flask API accepts a set of input parameters and returns the predicted iris species based on the model.
